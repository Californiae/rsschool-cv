## About me :
 _Since structured and analytical thinking has always been my forte, it makes sense that I decided to pursue a profession as a programmer. I really enjoyed the learning process and my passion for this field grew stronger and stronger. After my apprenticeship, I worked as a 1st. Level and as a programmer in the accounting department. My job was installing and configuring software and identifying customer requests and market requirements._
